# rs-winapi-typedefs
This project aims to provide typedefinitions and constants for use with the winapi. Be aware that it is severely lacking in functionality as it is part of an ongoing personal learning experience and therefore only contains the definitions that are required for the time being. Out of these reasons pull requests won't be accepted. The use of this repository is discouraged.
